Golf is a very humbling sport. There is nobody to praise but yourself, nobody to blame, but you are also the one to face when things go horribly wrong. And trust me, they will. But through all of the good and bad, eventually comes clarity. You find the good shots that will keep you coming back. The shots that were just inches away from being exactly the way you wanted it. The mythical hole-in-one is a shot that everyone looks for but most of them come by sheer luck. It is funny, they have named shots like birdies, eagles, and albatross but I think they should name the hole-in-one a unicorn.
